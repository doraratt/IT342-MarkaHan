        Hi I'm El. I'm actually an introvert but when necessary, I go out of my comfort zone. 
        I'm 22 and I'm still on the verge of finding out what I really want, exploring various
        fields in IT that would pique my curiousity.
        The people who guide me and inspire me are the ones I'm thankful for. 
        So surely this year, I'll be challenged.
